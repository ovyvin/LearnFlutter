1. Tip If your Text is a literal, put the word const in front of it and the
widget will be created at compile time instead of runtime. Your apk/
ipa file will be slightly larger but they’ll run faster on the device. Well
worth it.

2.Tip The pubspec.yaml file holds all kinds of great information about
your project. It holds project metadata like the name, description,
repository location, and version number. It lists library dependencies
and fonts. It is the go-to location for other developers new to your
project. For any of you JavaScript developers, it is the package.json
file of your Dart project.

3. For Row:
mainAxisAlignment = Horizontal Axis
crossAxisAlignment = Vertical Axis
For Column:
mainAxisAlignment = Vertical Axis
crossAxisAlignment = Horizontal Axis
